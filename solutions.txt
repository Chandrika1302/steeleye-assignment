1.Explain what the simple List component does.
Answer:
const List = memo(WrappedListComponent);
->whenever a state changes the wholecomponent re-renders.And not only the main component if there are any child components they also re-renders 
-> Using memo will cause React to skip rendering a component if its props have not changed.
->so here whenever the state changes react renders the component except wrappedListComponent.
->so here, in the list there are lot f simple lists present and with the help of this data will be fetched from somewhere and that is mapped and stored together



2.What problems / warnings are there with code?
Solution:
There is only warning that I have faced when I run the code with the initial code provided by steeleye. That is:
"React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'setSelectedIndex'. Either include it or remove the dependency array."


3.Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.
Solution:
Check the List.js file for the code
